# <sphinx-themes.org>

Showcase for [Sphinx] documentation themes (HTML).

## Contributing

This project exists to be a showcase for Sphinx themes and we'd like to include all the themes available on PyPI. If you find new theme on PyPI, please file an issue or, even better, a PR for adding it.

[Contributing Guide] contains the details for how to add a new theme, how to work on this project and about how this website is generated and hosted.

## Acknowledgements

This project is made possible by the work of many [contributors]. Special thanks to:

- All the theme authors: this would not be possible without their work!
- @shirou: who created this website
- @pradyunsg: who redesigned the frontend, wrote the GitHub Actions-based site generation pipeline
